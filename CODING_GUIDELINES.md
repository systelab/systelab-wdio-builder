# Coding guidelines

If you plan on contributing to systelab-wdio-builder, please start reading the code coventions at https://github.com/systelab/systelab-angular-doc.

We will check each of them during the review process, but knowing about them ahead of time will reduce the number of 
iterations.

## General guidelines

- No hard-coded text anywhere.
- Always write code for full customizability, then add shortcuts to it. Writing the other way, limited features
which you extend later, leads to blocking issues that users can't work around.
